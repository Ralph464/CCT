    Josh Tyson. I really like this quote because it changed how I viewed the world forever.
      Everything is a ratio, everything is linked, and there is math.  This lead me down a rabbit hole in 
      which I looked into the human anatomy (generally how hormones and the human psyche).  It 
      completely changed the way I look at people.  As a result, it turned me cynical and mad.
      Nothing truly matters, except for human benefit.  Everything is calculated.  Everything is a ratio.  There is no escape.

            This is the manifesto of Matthew Cramer, "ring leader" of the notorius 
      underground organization "The Cult".  The Cult has wreaked havoc in our community
        due to their activities in the drug trade.  Their contributions
        has caused increasing drug overdose and murder rates. As "The Cult" faces their 
        RICO charge, it seems like the terror and torment that the group inflicted 
        onto the civilians and the police force is coming to a certain end.
